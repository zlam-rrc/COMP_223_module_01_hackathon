<header><h1>Introduction to MOBA</h1>
        <p>This page aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of MOBAs</p>
        <p>Beginning life as a mod for a game called StarCraft back in 2002, the MOBA genre has taken the world by storm.</p>
        <p>Boasting deep customization and high skill ceiling gameplay, MOBAs offer hundreds or thosuands of hours of riveting experiences.</p>
        <p>But what exactly is a MOBA? On this page, you will learn all about the mobile online battle arena genre.</p>
        <p>MOBA as a definition is slightly nebulous; there are many MOBAs and each has a unique take on the genre.</p>
        <p>But there are some key features a MOBA requires to be a MOBA.</p>
        <p>The first are characters. Each boasting a unique set of abilities, your character defines your playstyle and role within the game.</p>
        <p>Selecting a tough warrior might mean you are supposed to lead the charge, while an unarmored mage should support from afar.</p>
        <p>The second aspect of MOBAs are bases, and the defences they contain.</p>
        <p>Primarily, your objective is to attack the enemy base where they spawn from.</p>
        <p>The game ends when you destroy their base, or they destroy yours.</p>
        <p>Along the way, you will encounter some form of a damaging obstacle you must defeat with the help of NPC minions.</p>
        <p>Defeating the enemy minions and obstacles rewards resources, which can be spend improving your character for that match.</p>

        <h2>MOBA Terminologies</h2>
        <a href="https://culturedvultures.com/beginners-guide-mobas-best-games-terminology/" target="_blank">
            <cite>reference for the terminologies</cite></a>
        <p>
            Before trying to know what kind of MOBA games are out there and trying to find out 
            how to play MOBA, here are some of the terminologies that you may want to know before 
            playing MOBA.
            <ul>
                <li><b>AFK</b> - Not made for MOBAs, but certainly important to know. Stands for Away From Keyboard, meaning they're in the game,
                     but not playing. If you have a person AFK, you generally lose and everyone gets mad.
                </li>
                <li><b>Back or B</b> - To go Back means to return to your spawn point. Generally, this acts as a healing platform and shop,
                     so you'll frequently visit. If someone says they're going b, they're returning back to the spawn.
                </li>
                <li><b>Base</b> - the area where teams begin the game. Protecting this is the top priority, and you only win by 
                    destroying the opposing base. Goes by many names, such as Nexus, Core, etc
                </li>
                <li><b>Boss</b> - Another shared concept that has a unique name in each game. Denotes the biggest neutral creature 
                    on the map that, when killed, nets a major bonus to your team. In LoL, it's the Baron, while in Dota, it's Roshan.
                </li>
                <li><b>Carry</b> - the hero meant to kill the enemy players. This hero is generally weak early on, requiring time 
                    to build up, but will then be able to win the game with just a bit of help
                </li>
                <li><b>Creep</b> - the actual name for the creatures spawned from each base. Killing the enemy's creeps reward you
                     with money and experience. Your Creep Score is the number of creeps you've killed in the game.
                </li>
                <li><b>Creep Wave</b> - a full group of creeps. Each game spawns a set amount of creeps, waits a time, 
                    then spawns another group, causing waves of creeps. Hence, creep wave.
                </li>
                <li><b>Crowd Control</b> - Shortened to CC, this denotes attacks or abilities that cause some detriment to the 
                    enemy's abilities, be it a movement slow, stun, or a silence.
                </li>
                <li><b>Dive</b> - The act of attempting to kill someone while they're close to a tower. A risky play, as towers 
                    tend to hurt, so it takes a full commitment. You'll probably die and everyone will then get mad.
                </li>
                <li><b>Farm</b> - The act of compiling gold through killing creeps. More money means stronger items, which means that 
                    the Carry or carries on your team will need a lot of farm.
                </li>
                <li><b>Feed</b> - The act of dying to an enemy player multiple times. If you die a bunch, you are feeding, 
                    and the enemy player will get fed. This is to be avoided at all costs. If you're feeding, everyone will get mad.
                </li>
                <li><b>Gank</b> - The act of traveling out of your lane to try and kill the enemy in another lane. 
                    Usually called for if the opponent has a stronger hero.
                </li>
                <li><b>Inhibitor or Barracks</b> - The structure at the beginning of each lane that, once destroyed, powers up the enemy creeps.
                </li>
                <li><b>Jungle</b> - Denotes the area filling out the map between lanes. Tends to hold groups of Neutral Monsters that give good 
                    amounts of gold and experience, allowing for a player to become the jungler. The jungler farms the neutral monsters and tries to gank all lanes.
                </li>
                <li><b>Lane</b> - The paths that lead from your base to the enemy base. There can be from one to three lanes in a game, generally 
                    denoted by where they are on the overall map. Bottom lane runs along the south, Mid lane is in the middle, 
                    and Top lane in the north.
                </li>
                <li><b>Last Hit</b> - the act of getting the killing blow on a creature or player. In most MOBAs, only the player that gets the 
                    last hit will get the full amount of gold, so learning to Last Hit is an essential skill to succeed.
                </li>
                <li><b>Neutral Monsters</b> - The monsters sprinkled throughout the jungle. They don't fight for any one side, 
                    and don't really move out of their spawn point, called a Camp.
                </li>
                <li><b>Push</b> - The act of killing the enemy creeps quickly so that yours can get to the towers and base, allowing you 
                    to destroy them. If the enemy's creeps are attacking your stuff, you can say that lane is pushed.
                </li>
                <li><b>River</b> - not in all MOBAs, but the label is given to the center line that runs between the two opposing sides. 
                    In LoL and Dota, it's a literal river and is where you find the Boss.
                </li>
                <li><b>Roam</b> - The act of traveling between lanes to gank the opposing players. Usually, a roamer 
                    is someone who forsakes any farming to visit lanes as often as possible and hopefully kill the opponents.
                </li>
                <li><b>Skillshot</b> - Abilities that must be aimed manually, rather than just right clicking an enemy. 
                    They take practice, and generally separate good players from great ones.
                </li>
                <li>Spawn Timer - Neutral monsters spawn at certain intervals in the jungle. For LOL,
                    the spawn timer counts down from when they die, whereas in Dota, they spawn at set
                    times in game. Spawn timers play a big role for the jungler and Bosses.
                </li>
                <li><b>Split Push</b> - the act of attempting to push a lane while your team accomplishes 
                    some other goal, causing the enemy to make tough choices.
                </li>
                <li><b>Support</b> - Role given to heroes who generally don't cause much damage, but offer
                    other benefits to the team. If you lose the game, a lot of people will point to
                    the Support, and will subsequently get mad.
                </li>
                <li><b>Tower</b> - structures on the map meant to protect your lane from getting pushed.
                    Towers automatically target and kill enemies in range, starting with the creeps.
                </li>
            </ul> 
            These are just some of the terminologies that you will hear from your teammates whenever you
            are playing MOBA games. There are a lot more terminologies that you will need to learn and the 
            best way for you to learn is to experience playing MOBA by itself.

        <p><i>Also known as... AD Carry, ADC, Carry, DPS</i></p>
        <p>Often filled by heroes that have strong basic attacks whom start out weak in the early game but gradually scale into becoming high value for the team late game by outputting out highly sustained damage.</p>
        <ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Goals:</b> Focus on assisting Bot Laner as you are considered a duo in the early stages of the game, then provide more utility to the team later on.

        <h4>Mid Laner</h4>
        <p><i>Also known as... Mid, Mage, Assassin, AP Carry</i></p>
        <p>Often as equivalent in high damage output as the Bottom Laner, but through abilities provided in their toolkit rather than standard basic attacks.</p>

            <li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Main responsibilities:</b> Gain experience to have a level advantage and use that advantage to pressure your respective lane.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Goals:</b> Stay alive for as long as possible when engaged in team fights so that your Bottom Laner and Mid Laner can both output high opposing damage safely behind you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Example characters:</b> Tidehunter (Dota 2), Garen (League of Legends), Warrior (Deadlock)

    <h2>MOBA Games:</h2>
    <p>After knowing the terminologies and roles and responsibilities that you need to do in order to play
        a MOBA game, here are some examples of MOBA games that you can play with:
    </p>
    <h3>Mobile Legends Bang Bang</h3>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Legends:_Bang_Bang#:~:text=Mobile%20Legends%3A%20Bang%20Bang%20is%20a%20multiplayer%20online,called%20a%20Hero%2C%20with%20unique%20abilities%20and%20traits." target="_blank">
        <cite>reference for the mobile legends information</cite>
    </a>
    <p>
        Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (also known as MLBB) is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and 
        published by Chinese developer Moonton, a subsidiary of ByteDance. The game was released in 2016 and grew 
        in popularity, most prominently in Southeast Asia.

        At its base gameplay, the game puts 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 20-60 second 
        matchmaking and 10-30 minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over 
        three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own while securing objectives in order to pressure 
        the opposing team. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angle—winners 
        and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy.
    </p>
    <h4>Gameplay:</h4>
    <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. The game is free-to-play 
    and is only monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins. Each player can control a selectable character, called 
    a Hero, with unique abilities and traits. There are six roles that define the main purpose of heroes: Tank, Marksman, Assassin, Fighter,
     Mage, and Support. These roles determine the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Players can also set specific builds
      for heroes which include in-game items and emblems.
    </p>
    <h4>Ranked and Classic</h4>
    <p>
    Two teams of five players go against each other in real-time. Players will be matched in correspondence with their current ranking. 
    There are seven ranks in the game with Warrior being the lowest followed by Elite, Master, Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and the highest rank, 
    Mythic. A player can only invite and form a team with other players of similar rank or players that are one rank higher or lower.

    Taking down the opposing base is the main goal to achieve victory. There are three lanes in the game: The gold lane (top), exp lane (bottom),
    and the mid lane. Depending on what side of the map (blue or red) a player starts on, the gold and exp lanes will be switching places. Between 
    each lane is the jungle. The jungle can be divided into four parts: two between the enemy's lanes and two between a player's team lanes. The jungle
     has different creeps and monsters that offer buffs, experience, and gold.

    A player cannot attack the enemy base directly without taking down opposing turrets in at least one lane first. Each lane has three turrets that shoot
    at heroes and deal a ton of damage. To attack them without taking damage, a player needs help from their team's minions. Minions constantly spawn at the 
    teams' bases and travel down along each lane. The team to successfully destroy all the turrets in one or all lanes will increase their chances of destroying 
    the opposite team's base.

    In classic mode, the gameplay is similar. However, winning or losing a match won't affect a player's ranking. Players can also form a whole team regardless of 
    their rank differences and freely choose any heroes along with weekly free ones and any trial card they possess.
