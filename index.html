    <header><h1>Introduction to MOBA</h1>
        <p>This page aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of MOBAs</p>
        <p>Beginning life as a mod for a game called StarCraft back in 2002, the MOBA genre has taken the world by storm.</p>
        <p>Boasting deep customization and high skill ceiling gameplay, MOBAs offer hundreds or thosuands of hours of riveting experiences.</p>
        <p>But what exactly is a MOBA? On this page, you will learn all about the mobile online battle arena genre.</p>
        <p>MOBA as a definition is slightly nebulous; there are many MOBAs and each has a unique take on the genre.</p>
        <p>But there are some key features a MOBA requires to be a MOBA.</p>
        <p>The first are characters. Each boasting a unique set of abilities, your character defines your playstyle and role within the game.</p>
        <p>Selecting a tough warrior might mean you are supposed to lead the charge, while an unarmored mage should support from afar.</p>
        <p>The second aspect of MOBAs are bases, and the defences they contain.</p>
        <p>Primarily, your objective is to attack the enemy base where they spawn from.</p>
        <p>The game ends when you destroy their base, or they destroy yours.</p>
        <p>Along the way, you will encounter some form of a damaging obstacle you must defeat with the help of NPC minions.</p>
        <p>Defeating the enemy minions and obstacles rewards resources, which can be spend improving your character for that match.</p>
